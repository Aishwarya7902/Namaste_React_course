❤️ why not react from cdn?

✅ we will have to make a network call which is a bit slow , hence not preferred.

❤️ So what should we do then if not cdn?

✅ Since react is also a package at the end , and it is also hoisted on npm , so we can install it in our node module
  syntax : npm install react
this will install react into our project and is much faster.
